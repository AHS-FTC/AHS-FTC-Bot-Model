# AHS-FTC-Bot-Model
The official repo and BotModel of FTC Team 16896 Black Forest Robotics

AHS-FTC-Bot-Model is a class structure and testing interface for First Tech Challenge. Or it used to be. It's just some jumbled code now.
Meshed in with the model is BFR's Skystone code, opmodes included. 

RIP PlanElement Class. Fear the buck.
